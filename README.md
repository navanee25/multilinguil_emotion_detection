# multimodel_emotional_analysis
üß† Project Overview
This notebook implements a Multimodal Emotional Analysis system that leverages both audio and text data to analyze emotions using machine learning. It likely involves feature extraction, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using datasets like IEMOCAP.

üìÅ Contents
Imports and Setup

Loads necessary Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, sklearn, librosa, transformers).

GPU support for PyTorch if available.

Data Loading

Loads text and audio features.

Appears to use .npy files for precomputed features like:

text_features.npy

audio_features.npy

labels.npy

Data Preprocessing

Normalization of audio features.

Optional: dimensionality reduction or transformation (e.g., PCA not shown, but possible).

Model Architecture

Uses separate branches for text and audio inputs.

Merges modalities and passes through fully connected layers.

Likely implemented in PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Training

Uses cross-entropy loss.

Optimizer: Adam.

Training for several epochs with validation.

Evaluation

Accuracy and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).

Possibly confusion matrix.

üöÄ How to Run
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn librosa torch transformers
Prepare Data

Store your features in .npy format.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
np.save('text_features.npy', text_features)
np.save('audio_features.npy', audio_features)
np.save('labels.npy', labels)
Execute Notebook

Run cells in order.

Modify hyperparameters or model architecture as needed.

üìä Example Output
Final Accuracy: ~80-90% (depending on data)

Confusion matrix showing emotional class predictions.

Classification report with F1-scores per emotion (e.g., happy, angry, sad, neutral).****
